Hello viewer! This time I have tried a different analysis, and that too of the Netflix stock price comparison between years 2016 and 2019, and this time I made it interactive with the help of a filter, which is Quarter-wise segregation.

I have used some basic Power BI visuals to complete this dashboard, and I would like to explain all of them one by one:

i. KPI Cards: All the 4 KPIs - Average High, Average Low, Average Open, and Average Close have been created with the help of the Avg function.

ii. Average Price Comparison by Year: In this visual, I have used a Clustered column chart to show the Average of High and Average of Low of daily prices to check the changes of the stock high and low.

iii. Average Price Comparison by Year: In this visual, I have used a Clustered column chart to show the Average of Open and Average of Close of daily prices to check the changes between the stock's opening and closing prices.

iv. Minimum Volume by Year: In this visual, I have used a Line chart along with the Min function to check the year-wise minimum stock volume trade.

v. Maximum Volume by Year: In this visual, I have used a Line chart along with the Max function to check the year-wise maximum stock volume trade.

vi. Stock Volume by Year: Here I have used a Clustered bar chart to check how much stock volume trade is done in a particular year.
